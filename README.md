# Higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at alx-Holberton curriculum.

### `What are High-level programming language`
- High-level programming languages are designed to provide a more abstract and user-friendly interface for writing software, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their programs rather than the low-level details of the computer's architecture. High-level source code contains easy-to-read syntax that is later converted into a low-level language, which can be recognized and run by a specific CPU.

- A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.
